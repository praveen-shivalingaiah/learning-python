Day 1

Starting with the question why learn Python

1. Complex Logic: Python is a full-fledged programming language and is well-suited for tasks that involve complex logic, data structures, and algorithms. If your task requires extensive data manipulation, Python can be a more powerful choice.

2. Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python is more platform-independent than shell scripting, making it a better choice for tasks that need to run on different operating systems.

3. API Integration: Python has extensive libraries and modules for interacting with APIs, databases, and web services. If your task involves working with APIs, Python may be a better choice.

4. Reusable Code: If you plan to reuse your code or build larger applications, Python's structure and modularity make it easier to manage and maintain.

5. Error Handling: Python provides better error handling and debugging capabilities, which can be valuable in DevOps where reliability is crucial.

6. Advanced Data Processing: If your task involves advanced data processing, data analysis, or machine learning, Python's rich ecosystem of libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, SciPy) makes it a more suitable choice.
